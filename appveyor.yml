  # you can remove "build.cmd" from the front of the command, as it's
  # only needed to support those cases.

  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.

after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.

  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
